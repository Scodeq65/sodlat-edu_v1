# Introduction
Welcome to the SodLat Edu Solution! This project aims to create a unified platform that connects parents, teachers, and students, making communication and educational management more efficient and effective. This solution is built with a focus on usability, accessibility, and scalability, ensuring that users from different backgrounds can easily navigate and use the platform.

# Project Overview
SodLat Edu Solution is designed to streamline the interactions between parents, teachers, and students. It provides separate portals for each user type, allowing them to access relevant information, communicate effectively, and manage educational tasks seamlessly. The platform is built with Flask, a lightweight web framework, and uses modern web technologies to deliver a smooth user experience.

# Key Objectives:
Provide a centralized platform for educational management.
Facilitate communication between parents, teachers, and students.
Offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
Ensure data security and privacy.

# Features
## For Parents:

View their children's academic progress.
Communicate with teachers.
Manage and track attendance records.
## For Teachers:

Manage class schedules and student records.
Post assignments and grades.
Communicate with parents and students.
## For Students:

Communicate with teachers.

# Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
Backend: Flask, Flask-CORS, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Migrate, Flask-RESTful
Database: SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (for production)
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Deployment: AWS (with Heroku as an alternative)

# Alternative Technologies Considered:
## Heroku vs. AWS:

AWS: Offers more control and customization but requires more setup and management.
Heroku: Easier to deploy but offers less control over server configurations.
Flask vs. Django:

Flask: Lightweight and easy to get started with, ideal for smaller applications.
Django: More features out-of-the-box but may be overkill for this project’s scope.

# API Endpoints
Here are the key API endpoints available in the SodLat Edu Solution:

/api/students

GET: Retrieve a list of students.
POST: Add a new student.
/api/teachers

GET: Retrieve a list of teachers.
POST: Add a new teacher.
/api/parents

GET: Retrieve a list of parents.
POST: Add a new parent.
/api/assignments

GET: Retrieve a list of assignments.
POST: Add a new assignment.

# Data Model
## Database Structure:
The data model consists of tables for Students, Teachers, Parents, and Assignments. Each table is linked through relationships that ensure data integrity and facilitate efficient querying.

Example:

Students Table: Contains student information such as name, age, class, and related parent ID.
Teachers Table: Contains teacher information such as name, subject, and class ID.

# Mockups
The platform includes three dashboards:

Parent Dashboard: Displays student progress, attendance, and communication tools.
Teacher Dashboard: Manages classes, assignments, and student records.
Student Dashboard: Allows students to view assignments, grades, and schedules.
Mockups have been created to visualize each of these dashboards and guide the development process.
